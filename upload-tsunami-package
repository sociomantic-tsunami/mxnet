# Helper script to upload tsunami libmxnet packages to the correct bintray repo
#
################################################################################
#
# This script parses the `TRAVIS_TAG` (i.e. the git tag containing the version
# of the package that has been built) to determine where to upload the package:
#
#   * package versions containing any of the words `alpha`, `beta` or `rc`
#     (whether in the upstream version or the package iteration) will be
#     uploaded to the `prerelease` repo
#
#   * otherwise, it is inferred the package is a stable release, and it
#     will be uploaded to the `release` repo
